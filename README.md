## Kinematic-Inertial fusion for cable robots using ROS
### Compile ROS nodes for the solver and estimator for IMU fusion

- Setup a catkin workspace and get the code

  ```bash
  mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
  catkin init
  cd src
  git clone git@github.com:aau-cns/scampi_ks_mars_fusion.git
  ```

- Compile and install the solver
  ```bash
  cd scampi_ks_mars_fusion
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  cd solver
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  sudo make all
  pip3 install .
  ```

- Get the code for the estimator as a git submodule and build the ROS nodes
  ```bash
  cd ../.. # back to .../scampi_ks_mars_fusion
  catkin build scampi_ks_ros
  ```
- Replace some files:
  ```
  cd ros/pose_wrapper_scampi
  cp mars_pose.launch ../mars_ros/launch/mars_pose.launch
  cp mars_wrapper_pose.cpp ../mars_ros/src/mars_wrapper_pose.cpp
  cp mars_wrapper_pose.h ../mars_ros/include/mars_wrapper_pose.h
  cp pose_config.yaml ../mars_ros/launch/config/pose_config.yaml
  ```

- Source your catkin workspace such that you can use the nodes now
  ```bash
  cd ../.. # back to .../catkin_ws
  source devel/setup.bash
  ```

### Run ROS nodes for the solver and estimator for IMU fusion
Our software setup has **4 main components**:
- The kinematic solver (with an equilibrium detector) `scampi_ks_ros`
- The estimator for IMU fusion `mars_ros`
- Two scripts for configuration of the solver
  - send_init_cable_length.py
  - set_pose_source.py
- ROS tools (roscore, rosbag, rviz)

**Procedure**: The kinematic solver needs to know the total initial cable length from the pulley to the anchors,
such that later cable encoder readings can be used to increment the total cable length.
Furthermore, the solver starts in 'standalone' mode, meaning that it computes the
end-effector pose from previous results, without using the output of the
estimator.
The estimator initializes itself with the output of the solver in standalone mode.
One additional solver output is used for the first update of the estimator.
At this point we consider the estimator to be robust and can use its output in the solver.

**Cable length input to the solver:** We assume that the input to the solver has the form
l_input = l_pulley_to_anchor + l_other.
Only the last part of the cable connecting the anchor on the end-effector and the pulley is relevant for us, this is described as l_pulley_to_anchor. And l_other describes all other cable parts which are not relevant for catenary computations, e.g. the length of the cable going from winch to pulley.
l_other is considered to be constant.
One time at the beginning the true l_pulley_to_anchor needs to be known and send to the solver, such that we can compute the constant l_other.

- Start ROS and replay the bagfile
  ```bash
  # TERMINAL 1, 2 tabs
  cd location/of/bagfile
  roscore
  rosbag play 2D_CD_TC21_1_2020-12-01-16-56-00.bag  --pause -r 1.0 # start in pause mode
  ```

- On each new terminal that is started the setup.bash in devel needs to be sourced like this `source devel/setup.bash`.
Or the sourcing is written to the `.bashrc` file, such that this is automated.

- Start the estimator, the equilibrium detector and the kinematic solvers
  ```bash
  # TERMINAL 2, 3 tabs
  cd catkin_ws
  source devel/setup.bash
  # Estimator
  roslaunch mars_ros mars_pose.launch imu_in_topic:=/mti/sensor/imu pose_with_cov_in_topic:=/equilibrium_detector/eq_pose
  # Equilibrium detector (Not doing much yet, future work)
  roslaunch equilibrium_detector equilibrium_detector_node.launch
  # Kinematics solvers
  roslaunch scampi_ks_ros solver_start_prop.launch
  ```

- Configure the solver and initialize estimator, let the bagfile run
  ```bash
  # TERMINAL 3
  cd scampi_ks_mars_fusion/ros
  # Set the true l_pulley_to_anchor, see notes on cable length input
  python send_init_cable_length.py
  # In the bagfile terminal, play back the bagfile a few steps by hitting 's' some seconds
  # until in the estimator tab the following messsage comes:
  #
  # "Update: 1.60684e+09
  # Warning: Core is not initialized yet. Measurement is stored but not processed"
  #
  # This initialized the estimator and updated it once.
  # Now the estimator can be used as input for the solver
  python set_pose_source.py 1
  # In the bagfile terminal, hit 'space' and just let the bagfile run.
  ```

- Visualize the data in rviz
  ```bash
  # Another terminal
  rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 world map 100
  # Another terminal
  rosrun rviz rviz
  # open the provided rviz config
  ```

- Record data for plotting
  ```bash
  rosbag record -O test.bag /dh_optitrack/CustomDolly/pose /dh_optitrack/D2BackLeft/pose /dh_optitrack/D2BackRight/pose /dh_optitrack/D2FrontLeft/pose /dh_optitrack/D2FrontRight/pose /equilibrium_detector/eq_pose /mars_pose_node/pose_state_out /mars_pose_node/pose_state_out_center /mti/sensor/imu /scampi_ks_ros/fk_pose /spc_ADS_node/spc_cable_length /spc_ADS_node/spc_dolly_pose
  ```
